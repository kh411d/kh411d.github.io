  <h1>Bye Wordpress, Hello ... ?</h1>
  <span class="post-date">Tue, May 3, 2016</span>
  <p><img src="/images/jekyllbloggingthesedays.jpg" alt="Jekyll blogging these days" /> It&rsquo;s been a long years since I used wordpress on 2006 as my blogging platform, back in the old days there&rsquo;s nothing can beat what wordpress offer for bloggers. So many themes, plugins, and It&rsquo;s still the most-used and well known blogging platform until now.</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress/all/all">W3Techs 2016 Survey</a>, WordPress is used by 59.3% of all the websites whose content management system we know. This is 26.4% of all websites. Every years website powered by wordpress is significantly rise.</p>

<p>I really miss the old days when Wordpress was a pretty damn simple software that is very good at what it does, but nowadays the word &ldquo;simple&rdquo; is not included in Wordpress dictionary anymore. Wordpress is evolving bigger and bigger each days, even a basic installation requires maintenance. Themes, plugins, a database, the server, regular and multiple backups. All demand your attention. I ended up spending too much time configuring the systemâ€™s moving parts rather than focus on my content.</p>

<p>No, I&rsquo;m not embracing people to move from wordpress. Wordpress is a masterpiece, plus its open source, and has a vibrant community around it. It&rsquo;s just not suit anymore for my need, a simple blog. And then so I heard Jekyll, a simple static site generator which has no requirements for database, no need a server, no need an interpreter (PHP, Python, Nodejs, etc), no backend, no wysiwyg editor, much simpler and It is much more less powerful than WordPress in many aspects but if offers me what I need in a more simpler way.</p>

<p>You can write your content in any text editor in Markdown Syntax, no visual editor like in Wordpress. Surprisingly, your writing process will be much more quickest than using the visual editor.</p>

<p>As a developer, installing jekyll is a breeze for me, it does require some technical knowledge such as ruby gem, npm, git, ftp, etc. I&rsquo;m not sure if a common blogger can do this alone without guidance from any tech savvy. Because Jekyll by itself is not a blogging or cms platform, its a static site generator that will generate html files for you which you can upload later on to your hosting provider by FTP</p>

<p>I choose Jekyll because it has a lot community and very actively developed. No need Caching anymore, no need WP-Super-Cache, no need updating your wp-core anymore, no need to worry when your site go down, and its a pretty damn fast blog ever, you may test it with google pagespeed tool.</p>
