Had enough with all smartwatch vendor these days, and it's time to give my feedback base on 3 years experience using the pebble watch. 

I'm going to share about what feature is really working or not, and if you are a smartwatch maker that just happens reading this blog I'm hoping this post will be a clue for your next flagship idea.

It's all more to smartwatch functionality, I don't care whether it comes with a fancy strap, stainless/plastic body, or a screen made by a gorilla, as long as it is sturdy enough, it's ok with me.

So then here I'm going to rank the features from most used to the most useless.

1. **Long battery life**

    Yes, this is the most important feature, seriously who wants to charge their watch every day or maybe every couple of times? IMO battery life should be longer than a week, below that, it is a goodbye, sayonara.

    

2. **Always ON Display**

    Seriously, I really don't want to have to flick my hand or touching my watch just to see what time is it now.   

    

3. **"Readable" Notifications and Vibration**

    Of course, there should be a readable notification and vibrated. Readable means that we can always read part of the message instead of a notification sign that requires you to check your smartphone to read the message.

    

4. **Two-way communications**

    This feature is related to how we actually handle the notification message such as replying or deleting a message and the other example is a remote music player that can control your phone music player or any devices.

    

5. **Bluetooth Connection**

    

    Till now I guess this is the lowest energy usage alternative for connection between watch and cellphone or any other devices.

    

6. **Accelerometer & Magnetometer**

    The basic sensor that every smartwatch should have, gesture detection and a compass, tracking your movement while you're jog, sleeping, swimming, etc.

7. **Watch apps**

    Community driven, Open API, and asking the community to develop apps for your product is actually a good strategy, of course, both vendor and user can gain a lot of benefits.

    **_The list below I considered being nice things to have on your smartwatch._**

    

8. **Standalone GPS**

    Cool thing to have, I use GPS usually for jogging, pace tracking, view map on watch, etc. You don't have to bring your phone while you jog, as an alternative you can always connect to your phone to fetch GPS data. As a drawback, this feature will drain the battery very quickly. 

    

9. **Color Graphical UI**

    This will make the smartwatch much fancier and doesn't bore the user, black n white is enough but colorful is good enough, as long as it can maintain battery lifetime.

10. **NFC Connectivity**

    So many things you can do with this feature, google pay, apple pay, Garmin pay, you name it,... unlocking your phone, your car, open your garage door, so yes it's a good deal to have.

11. **Touchscreen**

    Not so much important IMO, but having this could be very helpful for navigation, the benefit here is you will have a good UX with a loss of battery life. 

12. **FM Radio**

    IMO, FM radio is much more suitable for watches compared to mp3, as long as we can listen to the radio clearly, that's enough.

13. **Standalone Mp3 Music Storage**

    It's really a great feature to have, so you have music on the go while you jog in the morning without having to carry your phone or iPod, but then again I'm skeptical about the sound quality.

    

    **_This last list below will be a not so important feature, but yet it still exists._**

    

14. **HeartRate Monitoring**

    

    To be honest, I don't really like this feature on watches, the real heart rate monitoring should be strapped on your chest, however people tend to like this as a gimmick when doing sports activities. Buy a real HR monitor if you really need one.

15. **Microphone**

    I see a lot of things you can do with this feature, for example, you can have a dictating app that could take a voice note, using voice commands to do action on your phone or your other devices, etc.

16. **Speaker/Sound**

    This could be overrated, a tiny speaker for notification sound is ok, but for music, seriously… please don't.

17. **Digital Camera**

    Yes this feature is existing on a smartwatch, an IndieGoGo campaign for this watch is successfully funded, too bad it's shipped only with 5mp on image quality, battery life will be drained like hell, dunno how many shots you'll have till the battery drop.

18. **Altimeter, Barometer and Thermometer**

    Wow, seriously? Too much,  it's best to use a G-Shock instead of wearing a smartwatch.

    

19. **Wifi connection**

    Because Bluetooth is not enough, zzzz… come on!

    

20. **SIM card slot**

    OMG, this is a big NO for me, why? Do you want a watch or a phone? Pick one. It's not a smartwatch anymore, IMO battery might last only for 2-3 hours.

So here we are at the final conclusion, to all smartwatch vendors, please make something that is truly functional and useful, because everything is never enough,
