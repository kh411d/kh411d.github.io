One thing that you might consider when using VS Code is the keyboard shortcut because this can make your work much more convenient and faster, there's some shortcut that I use regularly, the key is not to memorize all the shortcut but to get used to so it could improve your workflow. 

I used a Macbook for development so these shortcuts might be different for any other operating system.
