Nowadays, a 3D printer is pretty much common among hobbyists, there are now a lot of variants of 3D printers, you can pick which one could print the fastest, which one could print a bigger volume, low maintenance, sophisticate, etc. People can buy from the very cheap to the most expensive machine depending on their budget and their need.

But, most likely, for people like me with a tight budget and got lazy to do all the maintenance and etc. Well, I guess it's easier to just order it from any local 3D printing service you could find.

A 3D printing service could help your model get printed rather quickly, mostly in 3-4 days your printed model will get delivered to your doorstep. Some services also provide a click and order through their website making less interaction with customer service, and some small business services also required a model inquiry through chat messenger before ordering.

I prefer the second one because I can talk with the expert/customer service and ask their opinion whether my 3D print setting (layer thickness, infill, etc) is good enough or need some modification on the model. After all the setting is agreed upon and calculated then they will come up with the price.

Don't look only for a single 3D printing service, most of the time I was looking at several 3D printing services I could find, and then I compare each of them before making a purchase. Before ordering, there are things that you need to consider regarding the material, the volume of the model, the usage of the model, etc. 

#### How big is the model?

Common 3D printers can only print a medium/small model (20x20x25)mm, (220x220x220)mm, 300mm, etc and for a larger model, you'll going to need an industrial 3D printer. So, you'll need to ask whether your model fit their 3D printers lineup or not, some service could also provide a tricky way to align your model diagonally or lift up the model with additional support so the model can fit with the printer dimensions. I don't recommend this way because the final result will lose some precisions.

Usually, after inquiring they will send you some images that show you how your model fits the printer. These are some examples, I went to some 3D printing services and I compare each of them.

**Vendor A**

They can't align the model horizontally because it won't fit the model so they make it diagonally, the cons are there will be diagonal thin lines instead of horizontal, for some people this could be annoying, the bed is also too tight so you might lose some precision here and the pros are if the model is lying down on the bed position that means it will have less support and less cost for the material, much cheaper.

**Vendor B**

The 3D printer is a lot smaller than Vendor A, so the model can't lie down on the bed position, they need to put a lot of support for this (the green one) I'm afraid it will lose some stability when printing the model so you're going to lose some precision also. You're also going to pay for the support that will cost you 30% more. Most likely I'm going to pass this vendor.

**Vendor C**

As you can see, the model doesn't fit, even though it might fit if you put it diagonally as vendor C did but they wouldn't recommend it because of the same reason. So, I would pass this vendor also, and thank you for being honest.

**Vendor D**

The bed is so wide and all the models can be put side by side, this is perfect and this might be the one that I'm looking for, a wide bed, no extra support, and all the models fit the bed. So this must be the winner.

#### How much stiffness does the model needs?

#### Is it for Outdoor/Indoor use?
