title: No Good Compact Phone is The Best Option

Aren’t you get tired with that weighty phone? The one that you might currently hold right now, questioning why my hand getting smaller, the phones are getting bigger and heavier. 

Some vendors even outsmart it by folding the phone, but still, double the weight, double the size, double the price. There’s must be a mistake here, or is it?

The phone used to be compact, lightweight, pocket friendly and could stand the test of time. I still remembered my 4 Inch [Nexus S](https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_google_nexus_s-3620.php) could last for 5 years until it gets laggy on running new apps. I rarely replacing my phone, I only had four kinds of phones in my entire life since 2000, each of it usually lasts more than 4 years, so buying a new phone is really a burden.

Old school phone seems to have more _balance between the hardware, the price, and usability_. Every year phones are getting bigger and bigger now, people now love to spend so much time in front of the screen.

Most people love bigger phones, but that doesn't mean they dislike the small one, it’s merely because _there are no good options out there_ if you look at the [Android Authority poll](https://www.androidauthority.com/big-vs-small-phones-poll-results-1126480/).

## Are you still interested in compact phones?

I would say compact phones should have less than a 5.8" screen size, with weight no more than 150gr and height no taller than 145mm, also they usually came at a good price. Currently, if you [search that kind of phone](https://www.gsmarena.com/results.php3?nYearMin=2019&nHeightMax=145&nWeightMax=150&sOSes=2,3) today, you'll get this top three and I would consider buying it, sadly they weren't good as they look if you take a look closely.

### Apple
__Apple SE 2020__ came with the same chipset as iPhone 11 pro the A13 bionic, which is great, it's built sturdy enough than Pixel 4a, and the smallest among those three, sadly it comes with a very tiny battery 1,821mAh and surprisingly it could take 2 hours to charge from 0%. 

I'm afraid the battery could not handle all of the power of the Apple A13 chip. I don't think the word 2020 is a good fit for the "Apple SE 2020". I would not take this phone on a jog with GPS on all the time.

### Google
__Google Pixel 4a__ is a good phone actually, it has a 3140mAh battery bigger than Pixel 4, it has a great camera the same as Pixel 4 has, include with 3.5mm jack, which is awesome, good storage at 128Gb and 6Gb RAM. 

The phone is not waterproof, has a plastic body, so they were not bend-proof. I would not put it in my jeans pocket. The phone chipset comes with Snapdragon 730G which is not the latest chipset, some people found laggy experience while scrolling, this chipset might become obsolete year ahead.

Unfortunately, this phone is good as if you're planning to buy another phone next year because I don't think that this phone could stand the test of time.

### Samsung
__Samsung S10e__ came with the latest chipset Snapdragon 855 (US/China) and Exynos 9820 (Indonesia), similar dimension as Pixel 4a, more variant in storage (128Gb/256Gb) and memory (6Gb/8Gb), sturdily built and waterproof.

Despite the 3100 mAh battery, most people feel the battery life is not reliable, this phone could get overheat very quickly. It makes me think that this phone has hardware problems.

This is also the most expensive among those three, one says the phone is too much money for too many problems, Samsung starts discontinuing this type in prefer of S10 Lite.

## Not Good options

When it comes to its price, both Apple and Google have a budget price, $355 for SE 2020, $349 for Pixel 4a, but not so with Samsung, $599,99 for S10e, but after considering all the facts, the price doesn’t seem quite right, especially for the S10e.

Apple SE 2020 and S10e is officially sold here in Indonesia, you can buy Pixel 4a from Singapore and then had to deal with all the hassle (overseas delivery, tax, customs, and IMEI registration). The price also going to be added up, approx $200 in addition to the actual prices, so it is not worth it.

The Apple SE 2020 sold here at $540, surely has a big margin from the actual price. It's the same price as Pixel 4a if you bought it in a local eCommerce store unofficially. Samsung S10e becomes unworthy to buy because all of the problems that would come up, the price could also rise to $700 and you get Exynos chipset instead of Snapdragon.

You'll be surprised if you compare to ASUS ROG Phone 3, Yes I know it's not a compact phone and it's pretty big, but the price tag will make you think twice, it sold for $670 in Indonesia, and you'll get the latest Snapdragon 865+ chipset, 5G ready, and an enormous 6000mAh battery. So hopefully it's going to withstand through all the years.

The close thing that I would buy for a compact phone is Apple SE 2020, but the battery and the price are not so compelling. 

To overcome these days' activities, I suppose the technology isn't here yet, especially the battery tech, no small battery with bigger mAh, no widescreen for a small phone, of course, or is it? The higher processor consumes more battery and usually produces more heat.
