title: Thanks Jekyll. Hello Hugo
---

I guess it's time to say goodbye to Jekyll and thank you. I just can't go further, I feel like Ruby is too much, struggling with all dependencies, build errors, etc.

Let me introduce Hugo, I can't say much about Hugo but that's a good thing, means that Hugo is so damn simple. Easy installation, easy to customize, easy to maintain. 

> Hugo is so damn fast, no joke. 

Hugo is single, yup Hugo is only a single binary file no Dependency Hell included, no worries if I updated my OS something would break, and it offers the same feature as Jekyll did.

And the most important thing is? Hugo has complete docs and is also supported by a great community as Jekyll did, and has a lot of themes too :)

Oh btw, Hugo is written in Go.

Willing to migrate? don't hesitate, just Go!  [Hugo.IO](https://gohugo.io/tools/migrations/)
