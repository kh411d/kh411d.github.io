I guess this is the time to say goodbye to Jekyll and thank you for everything after all this years. I just can't go further with you, I feel like Ruby is too much for me, struggling with all dependencies, build errors, etc.

Let me introduce Hugo, I can't say much about Hugo but that's a good thing, means that hugo is so damn simple. Easy setup, easy to customize, easy to handle. 

> Hugo is so damn fast, no joke. 

Hugo is single, yup hugo is only a single binary file no Dependency Hell included, no worries if I updated my OS something would break, and it offers the same feature as jekyll did.

And the most important thing is? Hugo has a complete docs and also supported by great community as jekyll did.

Oh btw, Hugo is written in Go.

Willing to migrate? don't hesitate, just Go! [Hugo.IO](https://gohugo.io/tools/migrations/)
