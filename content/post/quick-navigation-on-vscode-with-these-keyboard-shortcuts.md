One thing that you might consider when using VS Code is the keyboard shortcut because this can make your work much more convenient and faster, there's some shortcut that I use regularly, the key is not to memorize all the shortcut but to get used to, so hopefully it would improve your workflow.

I used a Macbook for development so these shortcuts might be different for any other operating system.
