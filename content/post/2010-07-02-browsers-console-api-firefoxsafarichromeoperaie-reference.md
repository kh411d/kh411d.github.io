What is Console API ? , I think this is the first question that will cross your mind if you dont know about this  
 helpfull tool, Console is a global variable/Object that provided by major browser like firefox,safari,chrome, etc... and contains many methods that allow you to write to the browser console to expose information that is flowing through your scripts.

Console API has become a standard for debugging javascript, so I suppose many browser should support  
 this kind API, well I think not all browser have the same standard but surely it has same use, these are  
 reference to some console documentation on each browsers.

I guess you guys already know some standard command like console.log(), console.dir(), ...

Firefox Console API Documentation  
 http://getfirebug.com/wiki/index.php/Console\_API  
 you may use it with our beloved "firebug"

Safari/Chrome Doc, I took from safari website  
 http://developer.apple.com/safari/library/documentation/AppleApplications/Conceptual/Safari\_Developer\_Guide/DebuggingYourWebsite/DebuggingYourWebsite.html  
 Use it with the web inspector.

Internet Explorer web developer tools  
 http://www.ieinspector.com/dominspector/manual/index.html?consoleapi.htm

Opera DragonFly  
 http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/introduction-to-opera-dragonfly/  
 I couldnt the list of the api, but I think Opera has a different way to debug Javascript

Finally if your browser is to old and couldn't have any console api, you can use this  
 http://github.com/NV/console.js/  
 its a Crossbrowser Firebug console API. Improves Opera Dragonfly and IE developer tools

Ok thats all I know, any addition please contact me...
