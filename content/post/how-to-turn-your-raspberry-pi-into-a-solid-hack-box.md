Have you ever been insecure while you are using any public WIFI? Did you suspect someone sniffing on your network, stealing your credential, phishing your network?

All of these might happened if you're using any WIFI connection in a coffee shop, a cafe, a coworking place, in a conference room, on your own office, or maybe in your neighborhood.

Of course, you can prevent this by using a VPN on a public network, but sometimes it just can't work, or maybe you are just too cheap for that expensive VPN subscription. If this happened, this Raspberry Pi (RPi) hack box could be a low-cost alternative to protect you from cyberattacks which might come in handy another day.

### So let's get started 

The RPi that I'm going to use is the 1st gen model B version. Yeah, I know it's 2021, so why not the 4th version. It's an advantage that the 1st gen doesn't need a lot of power to turn it on, so you can plug it into a laptop, power bank, phone charger, or maybe even the phone itself. The current that comes from those appliances probably these days would be around 3 Ampere that was more than enough.
