Have you ever been insecure while you are using any public WIFI? Did someone sniff on your network, stealing your credential, phishing your network?

All of these might happened if you're using any WIFI connection in a coffee shop, a cafe, a coworking place, on your own office, or maybe in your own neighborhood.

Of course, all of this can be prevented if you're using a VPN on a public network but sometimes your VPN just can't work, if this happened this Raspberry Pi hack box might be useful in another day.
