Have you ever been insecure while you are using any public WIFI? Did you suspect someone sniffing on your network, stealing your credential, phishing your network?

All of these might happened if you're using any WIFI connection in a coffee shop, a cafe, a coworking place, in a conference room, on your own office, or maybe in your neighborhood.

Of course, you can prevent this by using a VPN on a public network, but sometimes it just can't work, or maybe you are just too cheap for that expensive VPN subscription. If this happened, this Raspberry Pi hack box could be a low-cost alternative to protect you from cyberattacks which might come in handy another day.
