If you see the picture of the typewriter above, yes, that is staggered. It means that the keys are not in a linear position.

And also, looking at your keyboard now, there is a 90% chance your keyboard is also staggered.

So, what's wrong with the staggered keyboard? Honestly, there is nothing wrong with it if we currently live in the typewriter era.

Originally keyboards had to have a staggered layout to fit the mechanical linkages between the keys and the levers/arm, allows all the mechanical levers connected to the keys to having their own lane to move up and down and not collide with the levers of other keys.

Have you seen any levers on your laptop now? 99% chance the answer will be NO.

Have you wondered why the numeric pad is not staggered? hmm.. maybe because there is no numeric pad back then on the typewriter ðŸ˜‚

So why would the industry keep using this staggered layout?

The answer is because that's what people know, and thatâ€™s how itâ€™s always been done.  Maybe they're not willing to put sales at risk. They might also think like why would you sell a flat spoon instead of the usual one.

So, unfortunately, any new typist will actually have to get used to the staggered layout, which happened to me also, the first time I learned to type is with an old **Brother** typewriter in my 6th grade, I remembered how it gets me lazy to change the ink tape, correcting a letter with a **Tipp-Ex**, ripping off the paper because the lever gets jammed, and then the IBM computer came, of course, with a big staggered keyboard ðŸ˜‚

This staggered layout seems to have driven me crazy these days. I kept mistyping everything, especially for the symbols and numbers. I don't know if it's because me getting tired of stretching my fingers to get all those symbols typed correctly, or maybe it's because the pain I felt on my wrist.

**Keyboards without staggered keys are generally much easier to type on, but hard to find.** Fortunately, there's a lot of the so-called **"Ortholinear"** keyboard out there, or maybe an **"Ergonomic"** keyboard. Several keyboards has come to my preference such as portability, ergonomic, and ease of use.

My first look is at the customize [Planck keyboard from Drop](https://drop.com/buy/massdrop-x-olkb-planck-light-mechanical-keyboard) with low-profile switch and also a slimmer build and weight in just around 200gr.

And then the ergonomic [Atreus from keyboard.io](https://shop.keyboard.io/products/keyboardio-atreus "atreus") this keyboard is very small, compact, ergonomic, and weight in just around 300gr.

Lastly, the [**Corne LP** split keyboard from boardsource.xyz](https://boardsource.xyz/store/5f2efc462902de7151495057 "cornelp")  it's a split keyboard so it suppose to have more cables than the regular one, comes with a low-profile hot swap switch, and weight in just around 350gr.
