If you see the picture of the typewriter above, yes, that is staggered. It means that the keys are not in a linear position. And also, looking at your keyboard now, there is a 90% chance your keyboard is also staggered. So, what's wrong with the staggered keyboard? Honestly, there is nothing wrong with it if we currently live in the typewriter era. 

Originally keyboards had to have a staggered layout to fit the mechanical linkages between the keys and the levers/arm, allows all the mechanical levers connected to the keys to having their own lane to move up and down and not collide with the levers of other keys.

Have you seen any levers on your laptop now? Nope.  
Have you wondered why the numeric pad is not staggered?
Hmm.. maybe because there is no numeric pad back then on the typewriter ðŸ˜‚

### So why would the industry keep using this staggered layout?

The answer is because that's what people know, and thatâ€™s how itâ€™s always been done. Unfortunately, any new typist will have to get used to the staggered layout, which happened to me also, the first time I learned to type is with an old **Brother** typewriter in my 6th grade.

I remembered how to replace the ink tape, **Tipp-Ex**, ripping off the paper because you just had to, and then the IBM computer came, of course, with a big staggered keyboard.

I'm not a speed typist, my average is 75-90 wpm but this staggered layout seems to have driven me crazy these days. I don't know if it's because me getting tired of stretching my fingers to get all those symbols typed correctly, or maybe it's because of the pain I felt on my wrist.

### Alternative

Keyboards without staggered keys are generally much easier to type on, but hard to find. Fortunately, there's a lot of the so-called _"Ortholinear"_ keyboard out there, or maybe an _"Ergonomic"_ keyboard. Several keyboards that come to my preference such as portability, ergonomic, and ease of use.

My first look is at the customize [Planck keyboard from Drop](https://drop.com/buy/massdrop-x-olkb-planck-light-mechanical-keyboard) with a low-profile switch and also a slimmer build and weighs in just around 200gr.

And then the ergonomic [Atreus from keyboard.io](https://shop.keyboard.io/products/keyboardio-atreus "atreus") this keyboard is very small, compact, ergonomic, and weighs in just around 300gr.

Lastly, the [Corne LP from boardsource.xyz](https://boardsource.xyz/store/5f2efc462902de7151495057 "cornelp") it's a split keyboard so it supposes to have more cables than the regular one, comes with a low-profile hot-swap switch, and weighs in just around 350gr.

So what do you think? Should you move on from the staggering keyboard?

Well, if you feel much more comfortable with the current keyboard, I believe you don't need to switch but if you feel adventurous or for a health reason then I think you should try any of those keyboards, it won't cost you a fortune, hmm maybe on the shipping cost, and the custom tax ðŸ˜‚

To be honest I haven't decided what I want or what to buy by the time this article is written, because of the current pandemic situation everything gets complicated ðŸ˜”
