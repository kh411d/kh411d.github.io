If you see the picture of the typewriter above, in which I've highlighted the keys, yes, that is staggered. It means that the keys are not in a linear position.

And also, if you're looking at your keyboard now, there is a 90% chance your keyboard is also staggered.

So, what's wrong with the staggered keyboard? Honestly, there is nothing wrong with it if we're currently living in the typewriter era. Originally keyboards had to have a staggered layout to fit the mechanical linkages between the keys and the levers/arm, allows all the mechanical levers connected to the keys to having their own lane to move up and down and not collide with the levers of other keys.

Have you seen any levers on your laptop now? there is a 99% chance the answer will be NO.

Have you wondered why the numeric pad is not staggered? the easiest answer is because there is no numeric pad back then on the typewriter ðŸ˜‚

So why would the industry keep using this staggered layout? The answer is because that's what people know, and thatâ€™s how itâ€™s always been done.  They don't want to put the sales at risk also. They might think like why would you sell a flat spoon instead of the usual one. 

So accidentally, any new typist will actually have to get used to the staggered layout, which happened to me also, the first time I learned to type is with my grandfather old royal typewriter,
