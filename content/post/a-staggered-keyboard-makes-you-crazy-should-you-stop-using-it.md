If you see the picture of the typewriter above, in which I've highlighted the keys, yes, that is staggered. It means that the key is not in a linear position. 

And also if you're looking now at the keyboard that you're currently using, there is a 90% chance that your keyboard is also staggered.

So, what's wrong with the staggered keyboard? To be honest, there is nothing wrong with it if we're currently living in the typewriter era. Originally keyboards had to have a staggered layout to fit the mechanical _linkages between the keys and the levers_, it allows all the mechanical levers connected to the keys to having their own plane to move up and down and not collide with the levers of other keys. 

Have you seen levers on your laptop now? there is a 99% chance the answer will be NO. So why would every industry keep using this staggered layout?
