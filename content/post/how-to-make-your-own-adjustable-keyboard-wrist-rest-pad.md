Hi, thanks for your interest, this is actually my depression in finding any keyboard wrist pad which I can adjust accordingly to the height of the keyboard. If you happened to have so many keyboards with various heights, this is maybe the right project for you to follow. I've been googling around, going back and forth on any e-commerce but still couldn't find anything to my preferences.

So I came up with an idea, it's just a pad, what's a big deal, and then I'm researching any wrist rest products out there. I have my attention to the regular size of the wrist-pad, the height, the length, and the thickness. Then I grab some cardboard from my stationery supplies and start to make it my own.

This project doesn't need any specific tool, do not let your creativity down because you're missing a tool. The type of wrist pad I'm going to make is for 60% keyboard, the length of the keyboard is the same size as the A4 paper height. Fortunately, I have some A4 cardboard leftover with 2mm thickness, so I thought this is a good fit for the project.
