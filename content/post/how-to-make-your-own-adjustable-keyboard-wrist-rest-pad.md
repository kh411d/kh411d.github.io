Hi, thanks for your interest, this is actually my depression in finding any keyboard wrist pad which I can adjust accordingly to the height of the keyboard. If you happened to have so many keyboards with various heights, this is maybe the right project for you to follow. I've been googling around, going back and forth on any e-commerce sites but still couldn't find anything to my preferences.

So I came up with an idea, it's just a pad, what's a big deal, and then I'm researching any wrist rest products out there. I have my attention to the regular size of the wrist-pad, the height, the length, and the thickness. Then I grab some cardboard from my stationery supplies and start to make it my own product.

This project doesn't need any specific tool, do not let your creativity down because you're missing a tool. The type of wrist pad I'm going to make is for 60% keyboard, the length of the keyboard is the same size as the A4 paper height. Fortunately, I have some A4 cardboard leftover with 2mm thickness, so I thought this is a good fit for the project.

As you see in the picture above, you will need **2 to 3 A4 cardboards with 2mm thickness**, **repositionable glue**, **cutter**, **pencil**, **ruler**, **cutting mat**, and lastly, a **round cutter**, if you have a **hole puncher** it will make your life easier or if you want it **square**, **triangle** or else then you don't need this tool.

As I can remember, It took me for **approx 30-45 minutes to finish the project**, well actually it depends on how crafty you are. FYI if you have kids around I suppose you need to pause the project because this project will need a bit of precision, concentration, and also you're playing with sharp tools.

## Cut The Cardboard

First things first you need to cut each cardboard into 3 parts with the size of 7cm x 29.7cm, in the end, there will be 9 parts, I actually only use 7 parts, I kept the rest in case I messed up.

## Stack The Cardboard

Get all the 7 parts into a stack so it will form a rectangle block, **you may want to number each cardboard from 1st top to 7th bottom stack**, don't mark each side, just a small mark at the top right corner will do. This stack will roughly have **1.5cm thickness** combined, if you want it thicker then you can use all the parts.

## Draw a Hole Pattern

Before creating the plughole, we need to first draw a pattern to cut the hole later. The pattern for each part of the cardboard will be like the picture below.

Draw the dashed line pattern with your pencil, divide all the area as described, your cut hole should be in the center of the intersection line. You're going to cut the hole alternately, either start with the **yellow or the red hole**, you can only have **2 holes on each cardboard**. The cut hole size depends on your preferences **as long as not overlapping between the yellow and the red**.

## Cut The Plug

So here comes the tricky part, you're going to **make a plug on each part of the cardboard alternately**, from top to bottom of the stack.

I recommend starting from the bottom of the stack which is the 7th stack. I'm starting to cut the **two yellow holes** and make sure the **round caps** can be easily unplugged. 

While the 7th stack on the table, plug back the caps to the hole and then put glue on the top of both caps, just the top of the cap, don't glue any of the surrounded areas. 

And then put the 6th stack on top of it, you may need to position to align the stack, it's important to use repositionable glue, and then press it for a while, then disassemble the 6th stack. Now you're going to cut the **red hole (ALT2)** on the 6th stack and glue the caps to the 5th stack.

**Repeat this way alternately between the yellow hole and the red hole until you reach the top of the stack.**

## Final Result

So here is the result, I've done some customization for a small wrist staircase approx 2-3mm width, I don't use any precise size so it's only a hunch.

I'm currently happy with the result, maybe you can put some paint art on it, if you have a sweaty wrist, you may need to spray the cardboard with acrylic paint to prolong the usage.
