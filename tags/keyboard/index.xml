      <description>If you see the picture of the typewriter above, yes, that is staggered. It means that the keys are not in a linear position. And also, looking at your keyboard now, there is a 90% chance your keyboard is also staggered. So, what&amp;rsquo;s wrong with the staggered keyboard? Honestly, there is nothing wrong with it if we currently live in the typewriter era.
Originally keyboards had to have a staggered layout to fit the mechanical linkages between the keys and the levers/arm, allows all the mechanical levers connected to the keys to having their own lane to move up and down and not collide with the levers of other keys.</description>
