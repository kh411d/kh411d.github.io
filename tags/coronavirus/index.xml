Each government of respective countries has been driving its system and campaign to introduce the usage of QR code to minimize the spread of coronavirus. The system has become mandatory for people and businesses to follow and doesnâ€™t rule out the possibility of fines for not complying with the regulations.</description>

      <description>These days, a lot of conversations happen and people have many ways to express their feeling whether it&amp;rsquo;s sad, angry, happy, or even desperation. Emoji is one thing that you could never miss its sighting. In fact, the way that people use emojis could be related to our current circumstances.
At this time being, it canâ€™t be denied this is the year of the health-related emoji. The virus is everywhere ðŸ¦ , people wearing the mask ðŸ˜· all the time, which is an irony while France made mask compulsory in public but keep the ban on burqas and niqabs, people also got sick ðŸ¤¢ sneezing ðŸ¤§ everywhere, unpredicted fever ðŸ¤’ tragically end up in a hospital ðŸ¤• ðŸš‘ ðŸ’Š ðŸ’‰ , and people always remind each other to wash your hands with ðŸ§¼ ðŸ§½</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been 7 months since the #CoronaVirus encountered Indonesia, I remembered the news about a mother and her daughter were a suspect of #Covid19 infection from a Japanese foreigner, and till then, the outbreak is skyrocketing as no one cares.
Lack of testing and hasty actions to reopen public activities on a wide scale have kept Indonesia experiencing a spike in #Covid19 cases, the highest in Southeast Asia and past China.</description>
