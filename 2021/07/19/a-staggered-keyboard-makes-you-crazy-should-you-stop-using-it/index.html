    <p>If you see the picture of the typewriter above, yes, that is staggered. It means that the keys are not in a linear position. And also, looking at your keyboard now, there is a 90% chance your keyboard is also staggered. So, what&rsquo;s wrong with the staggered keyboard? Honestly, there is nothing wrong with it if we currently live in the typewriter era.</p>
<p>Originally keyboards had to have a staggered layout to fit the mechanical linkages between the keys and the levers/arm, allows all the mechanical levers connected to the keys to having their own lane to move up and down and not collide with the levers of other keys.</p>

<p>Have you seen any levers on your laptop now? Nope.<br>
Have you wondered why the numeric pad is not staggered?
Hmm.. maybe because there is no numeric pad back then on the typewriter ð</p>

<h3 id="so-why-would-the-industry-keep-using-this-staggered-layout">So why would the industry keep using this staggered layout?</h3>
<p>The answer is because that&rsquo;s what people know, and thatâs how itâs always been done. Unfortunately, any new typist will have to get used to the staggered layout, which happened to me also, the first time I learned to type is with an old <strong>Brother</strong> typewriter in my 6th grade.</p>
<p>I remembered how to replace the ink tape, <strong>Tipp-Ex</strong>, ripping off the paper because you just had to, and then the IBM computer came, of course, with a big staggered keyboard.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a speed typist, my average is 75-90 wpm but this staggered layout seems to have driven me crazy these days. I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s because me getting tired of stretching my fingers to get all those symbols typed correctly, or maybe it&rsquo;s because of the pain I felt on my wrist.</p>
<h3 id="alternative">Alternative</h3>
<p>Keyboards without staggered keys are generally much easier to type on, but hard to find. Fortunately, there&rsquo;s a lot of the so-called <em>&ldquo;Ortholinear&rdquo;</em> keyboard out there, or maybe an <em>&ldquo;Ergonomic&rdquo;</em> keyboard. Several keyboards that come to my preference such as portability, ergonomic, and ease of use.</p>
<p>My first look is at the customize <a href="https://drop.com/buy/massdrop-x-olkb-planck-light-mechanical-keyboard" target="_blank">Planck keyboard from Drop</a> with a low-profile switch and also a slimmer build and weighs in just around 200gr.</p>
<p><figure>
    <img src="/images/plancklp.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption style="font-size:0.6em"></figcaption>
  </figure></p>
<p>And then the ergonomic <a href="https://shop.keyboard.io/products/keyboardio-atreus" title="atreus" target="_blank">Atreus from keyboard.io</a> this keyboard is very small, compact, ergonomic, and weighs in just around 300gr.</p>
<p><figure>
    <img src="/images/atreuskeeb.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption style="font-size:0.6em"></figcaption>
  </figure></p>
<p>Lastly, the <a href="https://boardsource.xyz/store/5f2efc462902de7151495057" title="cornelp" target="_blank">Corne LP from boardsource.xyz</a> it&rsquo;s a split keyboard so it supposes to have more cables than the regular one, comes with a low-profile hot-swap switch, and weighs in just around 350gr.</p>
<p><figure>
    <img src="/images/cornelpbig.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption style="font-size:0.6em"></figcaption>
  </figure></p>
<p>Updates!! Not a while ago I found <a href="https://www.gboards.ca/product/gergoplex" target="_blank">the Gergoplex from g Heavy Industries</a>, itâs a split keyboard similar to Corne LP but with a slimmer body, because the controller is already included on the PCB, no double-decker mounting, and also much lighter maybe weighs in just around 250gr.</p>
<p><figure>
    <img src="/images/gergoplex.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption style="font-size:0.6em"></figcaption>
  </figure></p>
<p>So what do you think? Should you move on from the staggering keyboard?</p>
<p>Well, if you feel much more comfortable with the current keyboard, I believe you don&rsquo;t need to switch but if you feel adventurous or for a health reason then I think you should try any of those keyboards, it won&rsquo;t cost you a fortune, hmm maybe on the shipping cost, and the custom tax ð</p>
<p>To be honest I haven&rsquo;t decided what I want or what to buy by the time this article is written, because of the current pandemic situation everything gets complicated ð</p>
